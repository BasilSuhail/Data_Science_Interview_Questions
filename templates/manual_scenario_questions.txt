## General - Data Scientist

**Difficulty**: hard
**Type**: case

**Question 1:**
You are given a train data set having 1000 columns and 1 million rows based on a classification problem. Your manager has asked you to reduce the dimension of this data so that model computation time can be reduced. Your machine has memory constraints. What would you do?

**Question 2:**
You are given a data set. The data set has missing values which spread along 1 standard deviation from the median. What percentage of data would remain unaffected? Why?

**Question 3:**
You are given a data set on cancer detection. You've built a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96%. Why shouldn't you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?

**Question 4:**
You are working on a time series data set. You built a decision tree model but later tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy. Can this happen? Why?

**Question 5:**
You are assigned a new project helping a food delivery company save money. The company's delivery team can't deliver food on time, so customers get unhappy and receive free food. Which machine learning algorithm can save them?

**Question 6:**
You came to know that your model is suffering from low bias and high variance. Which algorithm should you use to tackle it? Why?

**Question 7:**
You are given a data set with many variables, some highly correlated. Your manager has asked you to run PCA. Would you remove correlated variables first? Why?

**Question 8:**
After spending several hours, you built 5 GBM models thinking boosting would do magic. Unfortunately, none performed better than benchmark. You decided to combine those models but ensembled models didn't improve accuracy. Where did you miss?

**Question 9:**
You have built a multiple regression model. Your model R² isn't as good as you wanted. You remove the intercept term and model R² becomes 0.8 from 0.3. Is it possible? How?

**Question 10:**
Your manager informed that your regression model is suffering from multicollinearity. How would you check if he's true? Without losing information, can you still build a better model?

**Type**: ml

**Question 11:**
Is rotation necessary in PCA? If yes, why? What will happen if you don't rotate the components?

**Question 12:**
Why is Naive Bayes so 'naive'? Explain prior probability, likelihood and marginal likelihood in context of Naive Bayes algorithm.

**Question 13:**
When is Ridge regression favorable over Lasso regression?

**Question 14:**
Both being tree based algorithms, how is random forest different from Gradient boosting algorithm (GBM)?

**Question 15:**
You've built a random forest model with 10000 trees. Training error is 0.00 but validation error is 34.23. What is going on? Haven't you trained your model perfectly?

**Question 16:**
You've got a data set where p (no. of variables) > n (no. of observations). Why is OLS a bad option? Which techniques would be best to use? Why?

**Question 17:**
What cross validation technique would you use on time series data set? Is it k-fold or LOOCV?

**Question 18:**
You are given a data set consisting of variables having more than 30% missing values. Out of 50 variables, 8 have missing values higher than 30%. How will you deal with them?

## General - Data Scientist

**Difficulty**: medium
**Type**: stats

**Question 19:**
How is kNN different from k-means clustering?

**Question 20:**
How is True Positive Rate and Recall related? Write the equation.

**Question 21:**
What is the difference between covariance and correlation?

**Question 22:**
Is it possible to capture the correlation between continuous and categorical variable? If yes, how?

**Question 23:**
Running a binary classification tree algorithm is easy. But how does tree splitting take place? How does the tree decide which variable to split at the root node and succeeding nodes?

**Question 24:**
We know that one hot encoding increases the dimensionality of a data set, but label encoding doesn't. How?

**Question 25:**
What do you understand by Type I vs Type II error?

**Question 26:**
What is convex hull? (Hint: Think SVM)
