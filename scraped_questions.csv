"<b>Grid Search</b> is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to <i>manually</i> give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.",,medium,coding,,github,,2025-11-21T13:05:31.726632
"<b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.",,medium,stats,probability,github,,2025-11-21T13:05:31.726666
"In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a ""simple"" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i>acquisition function</i> intelligently chooses (using a <i>surrogate function</i> such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.",,medium,coding,neural_network|probability|statistics,github,,2025-11-21T13:05:31.726714

In my experience, this is common when doing a geography based randomization on a relatively small sample size. Let’s say that you want to randomize by city in the state of California. It’s likely that even though you are randomizing which cities are in the treatment and control groups, that your two groups will have pre-existing biases.

In addition, I personally think that our value doesn't lie in calling fit(X, y), but being able to figure out if the model coming from it is appropriate and useful.",,medium,coding,statistics,reddit-datascience,,2025-11-21T13:05:34.820652
"**My Performance:** I correctly characterized the problem as a Binomial(N,p) problem, where p is the probability that a single particle survives till time T. I did not get a closed form solution (I asked about how I did at the end and the interviewer mentioned that it would have been nice to get one). The code I wrote was correct, and I think fairly efficient? I got a little bit hung up on trying to estimate variance, but ended up with a bootstrap approach. We ran out of time before I could entirely solve the last variation, but generally described an approach.

"6. You might be thinking “why would I need to use difference-in-difference in an AB test”? In my experience, this is common when doing a geography based randomization on a relatively small sample size. Let’s say that you want to randomize by city in the state of California. It’s likely that even though you are randomizing which cities are in the treatment and control groups, that your two groups will have pre-existing biases.

"Sometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team ""Y"" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team ""Y"" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role.

"\- If it is an entry level position: At first, I would be more interested to see if the depth of understanding in the process that took you to build it. Why? because it helps me gauge how you will think of going about a task in my team. Beyond the code syntax, I am looking for conceptual understanding that inevitably lead to mathematical underpinnings. I am not saying you need to know the entire derivation, but should have good grasp on basics. Example: In logistic regression what would happen if the threshold was moved way from 0.5? Is that good or possible? Why would you need it? What will happen if we move it down to 0.4? How do you decide where to keep it? Why would you be happy to set it at a particular value of say 0.5 or 0.6? How would you adapt if the data abruptly changes? Would you still trust the predictions, why yes or why not? Example-2: Why did you choose a sigmoid activation over relu? What would you do if you do not need an abrupt or hard classification around zero? In what cases would that be useful? ... you get the point! Practicing thinking to connect math to reality and reality back to math is what is needed. Nobody will ask you if you build a product using 100 GPU's. Why? because at this entry level employer is mostly looking to see if this person can also learn the custom code or concepts on job that are proprietary for the projects. And if you have have a solid grasp on basics as that knowledge is easily transferable.",,medium,coding,regression|classification,reddit-learnmachinelearning,,2025-11-21T13:06:04.520635

At that level it is more about can this person oversee multiple ongoing projects in parallel? Can the person provide technical expertise to other members of the team as problems come up every day? How good is this person to resolve those issues fast in less time? and more ... Therefore, usually we would look at past work experience. Here if the position oversees projects that run on 100 GPU's, then yes an experience in large scale projects is seen as a plus. So the interview may focus more on operational skills to develop and deliver a high quality product.

So if two attacks appear to have the same exact technique, objective, overall meaning and one has 90% success with the other sitting at 10%, we use this as an instructive example.

Career fairs are no different. The representatives bluntly told me that their company policy bars them from considering international students for their positions. Why is this suddenly the case? I remember getting responses from companies in October 2022, and I've also been interviewed by companies back then, so this has to be a new development. Is this new policy here to stay? Is there any chance for us to wait this out?

How much am I supposed to ignore the job requirements in a job posting?,,medium,mixed,,reddit-cscareerquestions,,2025-11-21T13:06:15.758965
"I’ve been told by a few people to ignore the job requirements or required experiences section of job postings.

If so, how much should I ignore or subtract from these requirements?",,medium,mixed,,reddit-cscareerquestions,,2025-11-21T13:06:15.759003
"I’ve also been put off when seeing the number of applicants statistics, especially on LinkedIn. Within one hour, a job has over 100 applications. I don’t feel like applying to a job with hundreds of applicants (when I have no experience) is useful. But I’ve heard a lot of those applicants are from foreigners looking for a visa sponsorship. Are hiring managers really sifting through hundreds of applications to find the ones to interview, or so they go through the first 50-100 until they have some candidates?",,medium,stats,statistics,reddit-cscareerquestions,,2025-11-21T13:06:15.759043

"I am a .NET software engineer with about 3 YOE, I have recently graduated master's in Interaction Design. My master's was a scholarship, and I applied to many universities and funds, and this is the one that worked out. So I went with it hoping for a better next job and hoping to expand my network abroad. Before my master's, I hated my job, we weren't doing actual work as contractors and there was micromanagement and master's abroad was my way out unemployed for a year. I finished recently and I started job hunting, I did a couple interviews here and there with no luck. I found out that one of the companies interviewed me for statistics for example, just to add my CV to the pool. As for another one, I applied too early and wasn't ready for the online assessment which was an exam of 3 Leetcode medium questions. And I was so invested in getting a job so soon because I was so scared of unemployment. I also interviewed for a product design role, because I expanded my skill set with my master's. I did well, but they chose someone else because they have experience in visual design, which I don't, and they expressed that and gave detailed feedback. So I ended up looking left and right, in all directions for a job with no specific field in mind. Recently, my old employer reached out, they have a new project and they are trying to recruit me for a product vacancy. Once they reached out, I spoke to an old colleague that I trust from my previous company, and he happens to be a lead at this new project. I sat down and spoke to him because I trust his advice. He was straightforward and clear that this is a project with no clear future and that if I am ready to join back with an undetermined future of this project, then I can join but I should keep job hunting outside. It's like joining back for money until I find something else. While I was speaking to him, he was overly straightforward and in a tough love tone, said that I was distracted and that I applied for some roles too soon while I wasn't ready and that I should be more patient, and he asked some questions that made me question my whole career choices and my master's and he asked me if I was able to define what an LLM is and what I know about AI and that this type of knowledge is very important nowadays, but I think I was too sensitive and got offended in a way. Tomorrow I am meeting with my old project manager as I said, and he'll probably speak about this new project in a way where he'll lure me into joining back. He might have development roles, I will ask about that, but he will try to direct the conversation to serve his purposes of expanding the new project team. I am also not ready to be the only product manager/owner employee, because I am a fresh grad and I need a mentor in my opinion. The advice I need is related to my expertise. What can I do to find my focus and be able to get a job and prove that I have what employers want? I know I am too distracted, how can I fix this.",,medium,coding,statistics,reddit-cscareerquestions,,2025-11-21T13:06:15.759296

"I got an internship doing data science for the federal government instead, but would be more interested in pursuing a path in the private industry. My program would allow me to take the time off again to do another internship, and the recruiter didn't mention a limit to when I could apply again (just to keep in touch). I have applied again for the same internship for Summer 2026, is it worth reaching out to the recruiter to let them know that I applied again? Or would it be better to reach out to the person who interviewed me?",,medium,mixed,,reddit-cscareerquestions,,2025-11-21T13:06:15.759372
