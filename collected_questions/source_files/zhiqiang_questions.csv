K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will ",2025-11-18T18:25:13.018409
"Explain how a ROC curve works. The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It’s often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives). ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zUWYO4VwGpoyu9oygT12F3hgZ30GxVY7sg_ZF46INrNbDutd9mVz9GnYIYGw2r1ZcbPLQXF4HV-uNXvQcVrP7Sg2BDDqRkaY3RAApumdXgH2mQZ8OCSgqqsVl7UDVjqwVFq224Z_) #### Q83 Define precision and recall. Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you’ve predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct.",,hard,ml,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"#### Q84 What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context? Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge. Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50",2025-11-18T18:25:13.018485
Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?,,hard,mixed,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a condition probably never met in real life. As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ",2025-11-18T18:25:13.018510
Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.,,medium,mixed,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting.

Many machine learning interview questions will be an attempt to lob basic questions at you just to make sure you’re on top of your game and you’ve prepared all of your bases. Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

What cross-validation technique would you use on a time series dataset?,,hard,mixed,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"Instead of using standard k-folds cross-validation, you have to pay attention to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data — it is inherently ordered by chronological order. If a pattern emerges in later time periods for example, your model may still pick up on it even if that effect doesn’t hold in earlier years! You’ll want to do something like forward chaining where you’ll be able to model on past data then look at forward-facing data. fold 1 : training [1], test [2] fold 2",2025-11-18T18:25:13.018662
How is a decision tree pruned?,,hard,mixed,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning. Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually ",2025-11-18T18:25:13.018686
"Which is more important to you– model accuracy, or model performance?",,hard,ml,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning model performance! Machine learning interview questions often look towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can perform worse in predictive power — how does that make sense?

How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?,,hard,mixed,data_science_general,zhiqiangzhongddu/DS-QA-General,"An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump: 1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset. 2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances. 3- Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.
