How would you approach it? Why might accuracy be a bad metric for evaluating success? \n* In Machine Learning, problems like fraud detection are usually framed as classification problems. In order to solve this problem we may use different features like amount, merchant, location, time etc associated with each transaction.\n* One of the biggest challenge with fraud transaction detection is- majority of transactions are not fraud, so we have inbalance data!\n* First step will be to do EDA and understand our data and intesity of class inbalance.\n* In order to handle inbalance data problem we can use one of the following method\n    * Oversampling — SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)\n    * Undersampling — One simple way of undersampling is randomly selecting a handful of samples from the class that is overrepresented.\n    * Combined Class Methods — Use SMOTE together with edited nearest-neighbours (ENN). Here, ENN is used as the cleaning method after SMOTE over-sampling to obtain a cleaner space.\n        * Developed by Wilson (1972), the ENN method works by finding the K-nearest neighbor of each observation first, then check whether the majority class from the observation’s k-nearest neighbor is the same as the observation’s class or not. \n        * If the majority class of the observation’s K-nearest neighbor and the observation’s class is different, then the observation and its K-nearest neighbor are deleted from the dataset. In default, the number of nearest-neighbor used in ENN is K=3.\n        * As ENN removes the observation and its K-nearest neighbor instead of just removing observation and its 1-nearest neighbor that are having different classes. Thus, ENN can be expected to give more in-depth data cleaning.\n* Test model performane for each of above technique and choose best performing model.\n\n### Why might accuracy be a bad metric for evaluating success? \n* In case of inbalance data accuracy metric is not usefull. Accuracy tells us how close a measured value is to the actual (true) value. But here we are more interested in fraud transactions.\n* We dont mind declaring few good transactions as fruad but failing to identify fraud transaction is not acceptable. In such cases classification of true positives is a priority, hence precision metric make more sense.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explain inner working on linear regression\nhttps://satishgunjal.com/univariate_lr/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What are the assumptions for linear regression\nLinear regression assumptions are as below\n* Data should have linear relationship between X and Y (actually mean of Y)\n* Data should be normally distributed\n* No or little multicollinearity (observations should be independent of each other)\n* Assumption of additivity: This means that each feature (X) should affect the target (Y) independently.

It does this by identifying patterns, keywords, and stylistic choices that are common in spam messages. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:\n\n**Steps in AI-Based Spam Detection**\n\n1. **Data Collection:** \n   * A large dataset of emails, both spam and legitimate (\"ham\"), is gathered.\n\n2. **Preprocessing:**\n   * Emails are cleaned and standardized. \n   * This often involves:\n     * Removing punctuation and special characters.\n     * Converting all text to lowercase.\n     * Tokenization: Breaking down sentences into individual words.\n     * Removing stop words (common words like 'the', 'and', etc.).\n     * Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\").\n\n3. **Feature Extraction:**\n   * Key characteristics are extracted from the preprocessed emails to help identify spam. These might include:\n     * Word frequency: How often specific words appear.\n         Let's go through an example to understand how **Bag of Words (BoW)** are used as input features for a machine learning model in spam email detection.\n\n        **Example Scenario:**\n        Suppose we have a small dataset of three emails:\n\n        1. Email 1: \"Buy cheap watches now\"\n        2. Email 2: \"Exclusive watches on sale\"\n        3. Email 3: \"Meeting tomorrow, please prepare the slides\"\n\n        **Bag of Words** creates a feature vector that counts how often each word appears in each email. Let's build a vocabulary of all unique words from our emails:\n\n        - Vocabulary: [\"buy\", \"cheap\", \"watches\", \"now\", \"exclusive\", \"on\", \"sale\", \"meeting\", \"tomorrow\", \"please\", \"prepare\", \"the\", \"slides\"]\n\n        Each email is represented as a vector of word counts:\n\n        - **Email 1**: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          - \"buy\": 1, \"cheap\": 1, \"watches\": 1, \"now\": 1, all other words: 0\n        - **Email 2**: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          - \"exclusive\": 1, \"watches\": 1, \"on\": 1, \"sale\": 1, all other words: 0\n        - **Email 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n          - \"meeting\": 1, \"tomorrow\": 1, \"please\": 1, \"prepare\": 1, \"the\": 1, \"slides\": 1\n\n        These vectors (lists of numbers) become the input features for the machine learning model. The model learns patterns based on word presence and frequency to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.\n\n     * N-grams: Groups of consecutive words (e.g., \"free offer\").\n         To understand how the n-grams input vector looks, let's use same example and see how we can represent emails using n-grams.\n\n        Suppose we have the following emails:\n\n        1. **Email 1**: \"Buy cheap watches now\"\n        2. **Email 2**: \"Exclusive watches on sale\"\n        3. **Email 3**: \"Meeting tomorrow, please prepare the slides\"\n\n        We will use **bigrams** (2-grams) for this example.\n\n        1. **Generate Bigrams**:\n           - For **Email 1**: \"Buy cheap\", \"cheap watches\", \"watches now\"\n           - For **Email 2**: \"Exclusive watches\", \"watches on\", \"on sale\"\n           - For **Email 3**: \"Meeting tomorrow\", \"tomorrow please\", \"please prepare\", \"prepare the\", \"the slides\"\n\n        2. **Build the Vocabulary**:\n           - List all unique bigrams from the emails:\n             - [\"Buy cheap\", \"cheap watches\", \"watches now\", \"Exclusive watches\", \"watches on\", \"on sale\", \"Meeting tomorrow\", \"tomorrow please\", \"please prepare\", \"prepare the\", \"the slides\"]\n\n        3. **Create the Input Vectors**:\n           - Each email will be represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the count of a bigram in the email, based on the vocabulary.\n\n        #### Input Vectors for Each Email\n\n        Let's create the input vector for each email using the bigrams vocabulary:\n\n        - **Email 1**: \"Buy cheap watches now\"\n          - \"Buy cheap\": 1\n          - \"cheap watches\": 1\n          - \"watches now\": 1\n          - All other bigrams: 0\n\n          **Email 1 vector**: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        - **Email 2**: \"Exclusive watches on sale\"\n          - \"Exclusive watches\": 1\n          - \"watches on\": 1\n          - \"on sale\": 1\n          - All other bigrams: 0\n\n          **Email 2 vector**: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        - **Email 3**: \"Meeting tomorrow, please prepare the slides\"\n          - \"Meeting tomorrow\": 1\n          - \"tomorrow please\": 1\n          - \"please prepare\": 1\n          - \"prepare the\": 1\n          - \"the slides\": 1\n          - All other bigrams: 0\n\n          **Email 3 vector**: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n\n        These vectors are then used as input to a machine learning model to learn patterns and predict whether new emails are spam or not, based on the bigrams present in them.\n\n     * Email metadata: Sender's address, subject line, etc.\n         * This can be a mix of numeric and categorical data:\n                * Numeric: Length of subject line, number of recipients, etc.\n                * Categorical: Sender's domain, top-level domain (TLD) of URLs in the email, presence of specific keywords in the subject, etc. Categorical data would need to be encoded into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).\n     * Sentiment analysis: Determining the emotional tone of the email.\n\n4. **Model Training:**\n   * A machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or even deep learning models) is trained on the labeled dataset. The model learns to distinguish between spam and ham based on the extracted features.\n   \n  \n5. **Model Evaluation:** Test the model on a separate set of emails to see how well it distinguishes between spam and non-spam emails. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate performance.\n\n6. **Prediction:**\n   * New incoming emails are preprocessed and their features are extracted.\n   * The trained model analyzes these features and predicts whether the email is spam or not.\n\n\n7. **Filtering:**\n   * Emails classified as spam are automatically moved to the spam folder or blocked, while legitimate emails are delivered to the inbox.\n   \n8. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update the model with new data and retrain it to improve its accuracy and adapt to new spam tactics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to build sentiment analysis model from scratch?\n\n\n**1.

The lack of performance here depends on the importance of the missing information. \n* It has fault tolerance:  Corruption of one or more cells of ANN does not prevent it from generating output. This feature makes the networks fault-tolerant. \n* Having a distributed memory: For ANN to be able to learn, it is necessary to determine the examples and to teach the network according to the desired output by showing these examples to the network. The network's progress is directly proportional to the selected instances, and if the event can not be shown to the network in all its aspects, the network can produce incorrect output \n* Gradual corruption:  A network slows over time and undergoes relative degradation. The network problem does not immediately corrode.\n* Ability to train machine: Artificial neural networks learn events and make decisions by commenting on similar events. \n* Parallel processing ability:  Artificial neural networks have numerical strength that can perform more than one job at the same time. \n\n**Disadvantages of Neural Networks**\n\n* Hardware dependence:  Artificial neural networks require processors with parallel processing power, by their structure. For this reason, the realization of the equipment is dependent. \n* Unexplained functioning of the network: This is the most important problem of ANN. When ANN gives a probing solution, it does not give a clue as to why and how. This reduces trust in the network. \n* Assurance of proper network structure:  There is no specific rule for determining the structure of artificial neural networks. The appropriate network structure is achieved through experience and trial and error. \n* The difficulty of showing the problem to the network:  ANNs can work with numerical information. Problems have to be translated into numerical values before being introduced to ANN. The display mechanism to be determined here will directly influence the performance of the network. This depends on the user's ability. \n* The duration of the network is unknown: The network is reduced to a certain value of the error on the sample means that the training has been completed.

(Here true positives are the spam emails)\n        \n    * **SENSITIVITY (RECALL)**\n    \n        Sensitivity is the ratio of correctly identified +ve subjects by test against all +ve subjects in reality.\n\n        Sensitivity =  (true positives / all actual positives)= TP/(TP+FN)\n\n        Sensitivity answers the question: Of all the patients that are +ve, how many did the test correctly predict?\n\n        This metric is often used in cases where classification of false negatives is a priority. A good example is the medical test that we used for illustration above. The government would rather have some healthy people labeled +ve than have an infected individual labeled -ve and spread the disease. We would rather be overly cautious and have false positives than risk wrongly identifying false negatives.\n\n    * **SPECIFICITY**\n    \n        Specificity is the ratio of correctly identified -ve subjects by test against all -ve subjects in reality.\n\n        Specificity =  (true negatives / all actual negatives) = TN/(TN+FP)\n\n        Specificity answers the question: Of all the patients that are -ve, how many did the test correctly predict?\n\n        This metric is often used in cases where classification of true negatives is a priority. For example, a doping test will immediately ban an athlete if they are tested positive. We would not want to any drug-free athlete to be wrongly classified and banned.\n\n    * **F1 SCORE**\n    \n        F1 Score accounts for both precision and sensitivity.\n\n        F1 Score = 2 * (Recall * Precision)/(Recall + Precision)\n\n        It is often considered a better indicator of a classifier’s performance than a regular accuracy measure as it compensates for uneven class distribution in the training dataset.

This is commonly found in self-reported measures that involves sensitive data. For example: Teens would typically under report the amount of alcohol that they consume.\n* **Data processing erros**. Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to outliers in the dataset.\n* **Sampling error**. For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in the dataset.\n* **Natutal oulier**. When an outlier is not artificial (due to error), it is a natural outlier.

There are two methods for feature selection. Filter method and wrapper methods. Best analogy for selecting features is bad data in bad answers out.\n\n## Filter Methods\n* Filter feature selection methods use statistical techniques to evaluate the relationship between each input variable and the target variable, and these scores are used as the basis to choose (filter) those input variables that will be used in the model.\n* These methods are faster and less computationally expensive than wrapper methods.\n\n#### Information Gain\n\nInformation gain calculates the reduction in entropy from the transformation of a dataset. It can be used for feature selection by evaluating the Information gain of each variable in the context of the target variable.\n\n#### Chi-square Test\nThe Chi-square test is used for categorical features in a dataset. We calculate Chi-square between each feature and the target and select the desired number of features with the best Chi-square scores. \n\n#### Correlation Coefficient\nCorrelation is a measure of the linear relationship of 2 or more variables. Through correlation, we can predict one variable from the other. The logic behind using correlation for feature selection is that the good variables are highly correlated with the target. Furthermore, variables should be correlated with the target but should be uncorrelated among themselves.\n\n## Wrapper Methods\n* Wrapper feature selection methods create many models with different subsets of input features and select those features that result in the best performing model according to a performance metric.\n* These methods are unconcerned with the variable types, although they can be computationally expensive.\n* The wrapper methods usually result in better predictive accuracy than filter methods.\n\n#### Forward Feature Selection\nThis is an iterative method wherein we start with the best performing variable against the target. Next, we select another variable that gives the best performance in combination with the first selected variable. This process continues until the preset criterion is achieved.\n\n#### Backward Feature Elimination\nThis method works exactly opposite to the Forward Feature Selection method. Here, we start with all the features available and build a model. Next, we remove the variable from the model which gives the best evaluation measure value. This process is continued until the preset criterion is achieved.\n\n#### Exhaustive Feature Selection\nThis is the most robust feature selection method covered so far. This is a brute-force evaluation of each feature subset. This means that it tries every possible combination of the variables and returns the best performing subset.\n\nReference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/feature-selection-techniques-in-machine-learning/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# In you choice of langauge: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50.

What happens is that after including the target variable as a feature, our purpose of prediction got destroyed. This is likely to be done by mistake but while modelling any ML model, you have to make sure that the target variable is differentiated from the set of features.\n* Another common cause of data leakage is to include test data with training data.\n\n> Above two cases are not very likely to occur because they can easily be spotted while doing the modelling. Below are few data leakage examples that are hard to troubleshoot.\n\n* Presence of Giveaway features\n    * Let’s we are working on a problem statement in which we have to build a model that predicts a certain medical condition. If we have a feature that indicates whether a patient had a surgery related to that medical condition, then it causes data leakage and we should never be included that as a feature in the training data. The indication of surgery is highly predictive of the medical condition and would probably not be available in all cases. If we already know that a patient had a surgery related to a medical condition, then we may not even require a predictive model to start with.\n    * Let’s we are working on a problem statement in which we have to build a model that predicts if a user will stay on a website. Including features that expose the information about future visits will cause the problem of data leakage. So, we have to use only features about the current session because information about the future sessions is not generally available after we deployed our model.\n\n\n* Leakage during Data preprocessing\n\n    * While solving a Machine learning problem statement, firstly we do the data cleaning and preprocessing which involves the following steps:\n\n       * Evaluating the parameters for normalizing or rescaling features\n       * Finding the minimum and maximum values of a particular feature\n       * Normalize the particular feature in our dataset\n       * Removing the outliers\n       * Fill or completely remove the missing data in our dataset\n\n    * The above-described steps should be done using only the training set.

It is sometimes referred to as the **selection effect**.\n* **Sampling bias** is usually classified as a subtype of selection bias, sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others.\n* Due to sampling bias, the probability distribution in the collected dataset deviates from its true natural distribution, which may affect ML models performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning\n|Supervised|Unsupervised|\n|:-|:-|\n|Used for prediction|Used for analysis|\n|Labelled input data|Unlabelled input data|\n|Data need to be splitted into train/validation/test sets|No split required|\n|Used in Classification and Regression|Used for clustering, dimension reduction & density estimation|","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explain normal distribution of data\nData can be distributed (spread out) in different ways,\n* It can be spread out more on the left (Left skew)\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-skew-left.gif)\n* More on the right (Right Skew)\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-skew-right.gif)\n* It can be all jumbled up\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-random.gif)\n\n* But there are many cases where the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right, and it gets close to a \"Normal Distribution\" like this:\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-1.svg)\n\n* The Normal Distribution has:\n    - mean = median = mode\n    - symmetry about the center\n    - 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean\n\nReference: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What does it mean when distribution is left skew or right skew?\nIn a **right-skewed** distribution, the tail on the right side is longer.

The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of weights.\n    - L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization.\n    L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization also adds a penalty to the error function.

It provides a single number summary of the ROC Curve, which measures the overall ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes.\n   - **AUC values range from 0 to 1**:\n     - An **AUC of 0.5** means the model performs no better than random guessing.\n     - An **AUC close to 1** means the model has excellent performance, correctly distinguishing between the classes almost all the time.\n\n### Why are ROC and AUC Important?\n\n- **Performance Comparison**: ROC and AUC help compare different models or different settings of the same model to see which one performs better in distinguishing between classes.\n- **Threshold Independence**: Unlike accuracy, which depends on a specific threshold, the ROC Curve and AUC show how a model performs across all possible thresholds, giving a more complete picture of its performance.\n- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: They are particularly useful when the data is imbalanced (e.g., detecting fraud in banking transactions), as they focus on the ability to correctly classify the minority class.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe **ROC Curve** helps visualize the trade-off between detecting true positives and avoiding false positives at various thresholds, while the **AUC** gives a single score that summarizes the model's overall ability to separate classes. A higher AUC indicates a better model for distinguishing between the two classes.\n    \nFor more detailed explaination please refer. https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explain Precision-Recall Curve\n\nThe **Precision-Recall Curve** is a tool used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class is much more common than the other.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Precision**:\n   - Measures how many of the positive predictions made by the model are actually correct.\n   - **Example**: If a model predicts 10 emails as spam and 8 are actually spam, the precision is 8 out of 10, or 80%.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - Measures how well the model finds all the actual positive cases.\n   - **Example**: If there are 12 spam emails and the model correctly identifies 8 of them, the recall is 8 out of 12, or about 67%.\n\n### What is the Precision-Recall Curve?\n\n- The Precision-Recall Curve is a graph that shows the trade-off between precision and recall at different thresholds for deciding whether something is positive (like spam) or negative (not spam).\n- **X-axis**: Recall (how many actual positives we caught).\n- **Y-axis**: Precision (how many of our positive predictions were correct).\n\n### Why is it Useful?\n\n1. **Better for Imbalanced Data**: Unlike accuracy, which can be misleading with imbalanced data, the Precision-Recall Curve focuses on the performance of predicting the positive class, which is often the class of interest.\n   \n2. **Visualize Trade-offs**: The curve helps you see the trade-off between precision and recall. For example, if you want a model that catches almost all spam (high recall), the precision might drop (more false positives). The curve helps you find a good balance.\n\n3. **Optimize Model Performance**: By looking at the curve, you can choose the best threshold that balances precision and recall for your specific needs.

It helps in identifying words that are most relevant to the content of a document.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n   - This measures how often a word appears in a document. A higher term frequency means that the word is more significant within that document.\n   - **Simple Example**: If the word \"cat\" appears 3 times in a document with 100 words, the term frequency for \"cat\" is 3/100 = 0.03.\n\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n   - This measures how rare or unique a word is across all documents in the corpus. A word that appears in many documents will have a low IDF, while a word that appears in only a few documents will have a high IDF.\n   - **Simple Example**: If the word \"cat\" appears in only 1 out of 100 documents, its IDF is higher because it’s less common across the corpus.\n\n3. **TF-IDF Score**:\n   - This is the combination of TF and IDF. It gives a score that indicates how important a word is in a document, adjusted for how common it is across the entire corpus.\n   - Words that are frequently used in a document but are rare in other documents get higher scores, highlighting their importance for that specific document.\n\n### Why TF-IDF is Useful:\n- **Identifies Key Terms**: TF-IDF helps in identifying the most important words in a document, which are often key topics or themes.\n- **Improves Search Results**: In search engines, TF-IDF can be used to rank documents based on their relevance to a user's query by focusing on unique and significant words.\n- **Text Classification and Clustering**: It helps in categorizing or grouping documents by identifying unique terms that define different categories.\n\n### In Simple Terms:\nTF-IDF helps find words that are important in a document but not too common across other documents. It’s a tool to highlight what makes a document unique, which is useful for search engines, text analysis, and understanding the content better.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Python or R- which one would you prefer for text analytics?\nWe will prefer python for following reasons\n* We can use pandas library which has easy to use data structures and  high performance data analysis tools\n* R is more suitable for ML than text analytics\n* Python is faster for all types of text analytics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?\n\n* In linear algebra, an **eigenvector** is a special vector that, when a linear transformation is applied to it, only changes in scale (gets stretched or shrunk) but not in direction. \n* The **eigenvalue** associated with that eigenvector is the factor by which it is scaled.\n\n**Why are they important?**\n\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues reveal the underlying structure and behavior of linear transformations.

This change can lead to a decrease in the performance of machine learning models because the model is no longer receiving the same kind of data it was trained on. \n\n### Key Points to Explain Data Drift:\n\n1. **Definition of Data Drift**:\n   - **Data drift** refers to any change in the distribution of data that a machine learning model was trained on compared to the data it encounters in production. This can cause the model to make inaccurate predictions or classifications because it relies on patterns that may no longer be relevant.\n\n2. **Types of Data Drift**:\n   - **Covariate Drift**: This occurs when the distribution of the input features (independent variables) changes. For example, if a model is predicting sales based on weather data, and there is a shift in climate patterns, the relationship between weather and sales could change.\n   - **Prior Probability Shift**: This type of drift happens when the distribution of the target variable (dependent variable) changes. For instance, in a spam detection model, if the proportion of spam emails decreases over time, the model might need adjustment.\n   - **Concept Drift**: This happens when the relationship between the input features and the target variable changes. For example, a model predicting credit card fraud may experience concept drift if fraudsters change their tactics over time.\n\n3. **Why Data Drift is a Problem**:\n   - **Decreased Model Accuracy**: Models trained on historical data may perform poorly on new data that has drifted. This can lead to incorrect predictions and reduced effectiveness of the model.\n   - **Impact on Business Decisions**: In many applications, such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, decisions based on outdated models can lead to significant financial loss, poor customer experiences, or even safety issues.\n\n4. **Detecting Data Drift**:\n   - **Statistical Tests**: Techniques such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, or Jensen-Shannon divergence can be used to detect changes in data distributions.\n   - **Monitoring Performance Metrics**: Regularly tracking model performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall) over time can indicate data drift if there’s a consistent decline.\n   - **Data Visualization**: Visual methods such as histograms, scatter plots, or density plots can help visualize changes in data distributions over time.\n\n5. **Mitigating Data Drift**:\n   - **Regular Model Retraining**: Regularly retraining models with new data helps to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest trends and patterns.\n   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing systems to continuously monitor incoming data and model performance allows for early detection of drift.\n   - **Adaptive Learning**: Techniques like online learning or incremental learning can help models adapt to changes by learning from new data as it becomes available.\n   - **Feature Engineering Updates**: Revisiting and potentially redefining features to align with the new data distributions can help in maintaining model accuracy.\n\n### Real-World Example of Data Drift:\n\nImagine a retail company that uses a machine learning model to predict customer preferences and recommend products. The model was trained using data collected over the past year. However, due to a sudden change in customer behavior (perhaps driven by a new trend or economic conditions), the products customers are interested in change. This change leads to data drift because the model's predictions are based on outdated information about customer preferences, causing it to recommend less relevant products and reducing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nData drift is a critical issue in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. Regular monitoring, retraining, and adaptation strategies are essential to ensure models remain effective as real-world conditions change.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explain transformer architecture\n\nThe Transformer architecture is a neural network model designed for natural language processing tasks, like translation, summarization, and text generation. It was introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Google in 2017 and has since become the foundation for many advanced NLP models, including BERT and GPT.\n\nKey Components of the Transformer:\n\n**1. Self-Attention Mechanism:**\n\nThe core innovation of the Transformer is its self-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence relative to every other word when generating a representation. For example, in the sentence \"She saw a dog in the park,\" the word \"she\" has a different relation to \"saw\" than \"dog\" or \"park.\" Self-attention helps the model understand these relationships dynamically.\n\n**2. Multi-Head Attention:**\n\nMulti-head attention enables the model to learn different aspects of word relationships simultaneously by using multiple \"attention heads.\" Each head learns a unique representation of the sentence, which, when combined, provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n**3. Positional Encoding:**\n\nSince the Transformer processes all words in parallel (not sequentially), it uses positional encoding to inject information about the position of words into their embeddings. This ensures the model understands the order of words, which is crucial for meaning.\n\n**4. Feed-Forward Neural Networks:**\n\nEach layer in the Transformer also includes a feed-forward neural network that processes the attention outputs to create more complex representations of the input data.\n\n**5. Stacked Layers:**\n\nThe Transformer is composed of several layers of these attention and feed-forward modules. The stacking allows the model to learn increasingly abstract and complex features at each layer.\n\n**Advantages of the Transformer:**\n* Parallelization: Unlike older models like RNNs, Transformers can process all words in a sentence simultaneously. This makes training much faster and more scalable, especially with large datasets.\n* Long-Range Dependency Handling: Transformers excel at capturing relationships between distant words in a sentence, which is essential for understanding context in lengthy texts.\n\n**Why Transformers Are Important:**\nThe ability of Transformers to handle context and relationships in a sentence far surpasses previous models, making them ideal for a wide range of NLP tasks. Their architecture has become the standard in the field, driving innovations in machine translation, text summarization, and language understanding.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explain the difference between prediction and forecasting\n\n* If you think of it like a detective story, prediction is about figuring out who committed the crime based on the evidence.
