How would you explain an A/B test to an engineer with no statistics background? A linear regression?,,medium,behavioral,communication,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- A/B testing, or more broadly, multivariate testing, is the testing of different elements of a user's experience to determine which variation helps the business achieve its goal more effectively (i.e. increasing conversions, etc..)  This can be copy on a web site, button colors, different user interfaces, different email subject lines, calls to action, offers, etc.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447381
How would you explain a confidence interval to an engineer with no statistics background? What does 95% confidence mean?,,medium,behavioral,communication,kojino/120-DS-Questions,- [link](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-confidence-interval-in-laymans-terms),2025-11-18T16:04:43.447402

What is R2? What are some other metrics that could be better than R2 and why?,,medium,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- goodness of fit measure. variance explained by the regression / total variance
  - the more predictors you add the higher R^2 becomes.
    - hence use adjusted R^2 which adjusts for the degrees of freedom 
    - or train error metrics",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447469
What is the curse of dimensionality?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- High dimensionality makes clustering hard, because having lots of dimensions means that everything is ""far away"" from each other.
  - For example, to cover a fraction of the volume of the data we need to capture a very wide range for each variable as the number of variables increases
  - All samples are close to the edge of the sample. And this is a bad news because prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample.
  - The sampling density decreases exponentially as p in",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447483
Is more data always better?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Statistically,
    - It depends on the quality of your data, for example, if your data is biased, just getting more data won’t help.
    - It depends on your model. If your model suffers from high bias, getting more data won’t improve your test results beyond a point. You’d need to add more features, etc.
  - Practically,
    - Also there’s a tradeoff between having more data and the additional storage, computational power, memory it requires. Hence, always think about the cost of having more ",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447495
What are advantages of plotting your data before per- forming analysis?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- 1) Data sets have errors.  You won't find them all but you might find some. That 212 year old man. That 9 foot tall woman.  
2) Variables can have skewness, outliers etc.  Then the arithmetic mean might not be useful. Which means the standard deviation isn't useful.  
3) Variables can be multimodal!  If a variable is multimodal then anything based on its mean or median is going to be suspect.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447506
How can you make sure that you don’t analyze something that ends up meaningless?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Proper exploratory data analysis.  
In every data analysis task, there's the exploratory phase where you're just graphing things, testing things on small sets of the data, summarizing simple statistics, and getting rough ideas of what hypotheses you might want to pursue further.  
Then there's the exploitatory phase, where you look deeply into a set of hypotheses.   
The exploratory phase will generate lots of possible hypotheses, and the exploitatory phase will let you really understand a few",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447523
What is the role of trial and error in data analysis? What is the the role of making a hypothesis before diving in?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- data analysis is a repetition of setting up a new hypothesis and trying to refute the null hypothesis.
  - The scientific method is eminently inductive: we elaborate a hypothesis, test it and refute it or not. As a result, we come up with new hypotheses which are in turn tested and so on. This is an iterative process, as science always is.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447536
How can you determine which features are the most im- portant in your model?,,medium,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- run the features though a Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to generate plots of relative importance and information gain for each feature in the ensembles.
  - Look at the variables added in forward variable selection",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447545
How do you deal with some of your predictors being missing?,,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Remove rows with missing values - This works well if 1) the values are missing randomly (see [Vinay Prabhu's answer](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-deal-with-missing-values-in-a-predictive-model/answer/Vinay-Prabhu-7) for more details on this) 2) if you don't lose too much of the dataset after doing so.
  - Build another predictive model to predict the missing values - This could be a whole project in itself, so simple techniques are usually used here.
  - Use a model that can incorporate mis",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447558
"You have several variables that are positively correlated with your response, and you think combining all of the variables could give you a good prediction of your response. However, you see that in the multiple linear regression, one of the weights on the predictors is negative. What could be the issue?",,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more explanatory variables in a [multiple regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_regression ""Multiple regression"") model are highly linearly related. 
  - Leave the model as is, despite multicollinearity. The presence of multicollinearity doesn't affect the efficiency of extrapolating the fitted model to new data provided that the predictor variables follow the same pattern of multicollinearity in the new data as in the data o",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447579

"Now you have a feasible amount of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection on the dataset?",,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- ridge / lasso / elastic net regression
  - Univariate Feature Selection where a statistical test is applied to each feature individually. You retain only the best features according to the test outcome scores
  - ""Recursive Feature Elimination"":  
    - First, train a model with all the feature and evaluate its performance on held out data.
    - Then drop let say the 10% weakest features (e.g. the feature with least absolute coefficients in a linear model) and retrain on the remaining feature",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447604
Your linear regression didn’t run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?,,medium,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- p > n.
  - If some of the explanatory variables are perfectly correlated (positively or negatively) then the coefficients would not be unique.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447614
"You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and find that in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?",,medium,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- The dataset might be heterogeneous. In which case, it is recommended to cluster datasets into different subsets wisely, and then draw different models for different subsets. Or, use models like non parametric models (trees) which can deal with heterogeneity quite nicely.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447627
"What is the main idea behind ensemble learning? If I had many different models that predicted the same response variable, what might I want to do to incorporate all of the models? Would you expect this to perform better than an individual model or worse?",,hard,case,data_analysis,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- The assumption is that a group of weak learners can be combined to form a strong learner.
  - Hence the combined model is expected to perform better than an individual model.
  - Assumptions:
    - average out biases
    - reduce variance
  - Bagging works because some underlying learning algorithms are unstable: slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs. If you can take advantage of this instability by running multiple instances, it can be shown that the reduced instability le",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447660

(Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.,,hard,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Start by fitting a simple model (multivariate regression, logistic regression), do some feature engineering accordingly, and then try some complicated models. Always split the dataset into train, validation, test dataset and use cross validation to check their performance.
- Determine if the problem is classification or regression
- Favor simple models that run quickly and you can easily explain.

What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?,,hard,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- The model that has high training accuracy might have low test accuracy. Without further knowledge, it is hard to know which dataset represents the population data and thus the generalizability of the algorithm is hard to measure. This should be mitigated by repeated splitting of train vs test dataset (as in cross validation).
- When there is a change in data distribution, this is called the dataset shift. If the train and test data has a different distribution, then the classifier would likely",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447836
What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?,,hard,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- We can have regularization such as L1 or L2 to reduce variance (increase bias).
- Changes to the algorithm:
  - Use tree-based methods instead of regression methods as they are more resistant to outliers. For statistical tests, use non parametric tests instead of parametric ones.
  - Use robust error metrics such as MAE or Huber Loss instead of MSE.
- Changes to the data:
  - Winsorizing the data

"What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate?",,hard,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- MSE is more strict to having outliers. MAE is more robust in that sense, but is harder to fit the model for because it cannot be numerically optimized. So when there are less variability in the model and the model is computationally easy to fit, we should use MAE, and if that’s not the case, we should use MSE.
- MSE: easier to compute the gradient, MAE: linear programming needed to compute the gradient
- MAE more robust to outliers. If the consequences of large errors are great, use MSE
- MSE ",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447866
What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced?

Pros: intuitive, easy to explain, Cons: works poorly when the class labels are imbalanced and the signal from the data is weak
- AUROC: plot fpr on the x axis and tpr on the y axis for different threshold. Given a random positive instance and a random negative instance, the AUC is the probability that you can identify who's who. Pros: Works well when testing the ability of distinguishing the two classes, Cons: can’t interpret predictions",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447887

What is regularization and where might it be helpful? What is an example of using regularization in a model?,,medium,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- Regularization is useful for reducing variance in the model, meaning avoiding overfitting . For example, we can use L1 regularization in Lasso regression to penalize large coefficients.",2025-11-18T16:04:43.447928
Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?,,hard,ml,predictive_modeling,kojino/120-DS-Questions,"- When we add irrelevant features, it increases model's tendency to overfit because those features introduce more noise. When two variables are correlated, they might be harder to interpret in case of regression, etc.

This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible. However, this is not always desirable for data analysis or predictive modeling as there is the bias variance tradeoff.
