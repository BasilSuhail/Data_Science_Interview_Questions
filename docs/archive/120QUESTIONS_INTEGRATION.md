## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Script Created:
`scripts/scrape_120questions_repo.py`

**How it works:**
1. Downloads 7 markdown files from GitHub
2. Parses `#### N. Question text` format
3. Extracts both questions and answers
4. Categorizes by file type
5. Assigns difficulty based on category and answer length
6. Outputs standardized CSV

**Parsing Logic:**
```python
# Pattern: #### N. Question text
question_pattern = r'####\s+(\d+)\.\s+(.+?)(?=\n####|\Z)'
matches = re.finditer(question_pattern, content, re.DOTALL)

for match in matches:
    question_num = match.group(1)
    question_block = match.group(2).strip()
    # Extract question and answer...
```

**Output:** `collected_questions/120questions.csv` (116 questions)
