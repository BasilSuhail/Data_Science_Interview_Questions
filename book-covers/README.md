# Book Cover Images Guide

## How to Add Book Cover Images

1. Save your book cover images to this `book-covers/` folder
2. Rename them to match these filenames:
   - `mathematical-intro.jpg` - A Mathematical Introduction to Data Science
   - `data-science.jpg` - Data Science
   - `data-science-practice.jpg` - Data Science in Practice
   - `data-science-foundations.jpg` - Data Science: Foundations and Hands-on Experience
   - `intro-data-science.jpg` - Introduction to Data Science
   - `materials-data-science.jpg` - Materials Data Science
   - `python-data-science.jpg` - Python for Data Science

3. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

## How It Works

- The carousel will automatically load these images
- If an image is missing, a colored placeholder with the book title will show
- Clicking any book cover will search for a summary including author, topics, and overview
- The book covers will scroll infinitely across the page

## Upload Your Images

Based on the screenshots you mentioned, save each book cover image with the corresponding filename above, and they'll automatically appear in the carousel!
